# FAQ

## Where do I put my docs?
Inside the `docs/` directory. Subfolders are fine.

## How do I add a new page?
Create a `.md` file and add it to the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`.

## Can I use images?
Yes. Store images in the docs directory (e.g., `images/`) and reference with relative paths.

## Do I need to install MkDocs locally?
No. RHDH TechDocs builds your docs. Local MkDocs is optional for previewing.

## How do I change the left navigation?
Edit the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`.

## Can I add plugins or themes?
Coordinate with your RHDH admins. TechDocs requires `techdocs-core`. Themes like `mkdocs-material` may be allowed.
